The important thing

https://github.com/AccelQuasarDragon/kivycollisiontest/assets/138998466/c58d794b-317e-4120-9c78-d9603de44060

TO RUN:

with poetry:

poetry update (to download stuff)
poetry shell (to get into the shell)
python drag2.py to run the example, the other examples were checking other stuff

with pip:

I did `poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt` so u should be able to pip install from requirements.txt

TODO:
    test it out on a non-mask image,grayConversion is on so it should work on any kivy widget...
