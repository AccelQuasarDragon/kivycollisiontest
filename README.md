TO RUN:
with poetry:

poetry update (to download stuff)
poetry shell (to get into the shell)
python drag2.py to run the example, the other examples were checking other stuff

with pip:
I did `poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt` so u should be able to pip install from requirements.txt
